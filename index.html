 <h3><font face="arial" color="red"> why I like crime series:</font></h3>
	<p><font face="arial" size="4">I love to binge watch this kind of series and channels during my free time because they calm me down and excite me at the same time due to the thrill of finding out what happens next. Also the fact that most of my family likes to watch them too so whenever someone is watching a show everyone comes to watch it together and when an episode finishes we have a descussion about what happened.</font></p>

To the credit of the producers, the show confronted sex shaming and victim-blaming for women other shows considered high risk targets.</font></td>
